                            Accountability for content:
                            The content of this website has been created with great care. However, no guarantee is provided for its accuracy, completeness, or timeliness. As per §
                            7 Para. 1 of the German Telemedia Act (DDG), service providers are responsible for their own content on this website. However, §§ 8–10 DDG state that
                            service providers are not obligated to monitor third-party information or investigate potential illegal activity. Liability is only possible from the
                            time of awareness of a specific violation. Such content will be removed promptly upon notice of legal violations.
                        </p>

                            This website may include links to external third-party websites, over whose content we have no control. Therefore, no liability is assumed for such
                            content. Responsibility lies with the respective provider or operator. Linked pages were checked for legal violations at the time of linking, and no
                            illegal content was identified. Continuous monitoring of linked pages without concrete evidence is unreasonable. Upon notice of violations, such links
                            will be removed promptly.
